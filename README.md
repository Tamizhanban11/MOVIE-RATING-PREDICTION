# Movie Rating Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict movie ratings based on various features such as genre, director, cast, release year, budget, and audience reviews. The model utilizes machine learning techniques to estimate ratings and provide insights into the factors influencing movie success.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming movie datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding trends, correlations, and key influences.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features for model training.
- **Model Selection & Training**: Comparing different machine learning models for best performance.
- **Evaluation & Validation**: Measuring model accuracy and performance.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the trained model for real-world predictions.

## Dataset
- Source: IMDb, TMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, or other publicly available movie datasets.
- Features:
  - **Movie title**
  - **Genre**
  - **Director**
  - **Cast**
  - **Release year**
  - **Budget**
  - **Revenue**
  - **User reviews**
  - **Critic reviews**
  - **Awards & nominations**
  - **Social media engagement**

## Technologies Used
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for visualization
- **Scikit-learn** for machine learning models
- **NLTK/TextBlob** for sentiment analysis (if analyzing reviews)

## Model Selection
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, etc.)**
- **Deep Learning (LSTMs for text-based features)** (optional)

## Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared Score**

## How to Run
1. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Download or prepare the dataset.
3. Open **Jupyter Notebook** and run the provided `.ipynb` file.
4. Run data preprocessing and feature engineering.
5. Train and evaluate models.

## Future Enhancements
- **Deep Learning Models** for better accuracy.
- **Incorporate More Features** like audience demographics.
- **Deploy as an API** for real-time predictions.
